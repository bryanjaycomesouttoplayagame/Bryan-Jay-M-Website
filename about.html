        <p><span style="margin-left: 40px;">In</span> the emergence of living in IT era, with a single snap of a picture tells a fresh, intuitive, wholesome story. There are instances in life that joy is less, too much or stagnant. There's a fragments in me that I want to rearrange, to complete and I need to fill the void of significant yet memorable experience. This series of photographs is a proof that memories does lasts and replays the moment in persons' mind, mine rather. These significant memories makes me feel nostalgic and sad. Makes me ask myself. How far I've become? Can I cope this? Am I gonna become a successful man someday? Those questions keep me alive quite well, when reality of life slaps in my face and sometimes having a delusional belief if this ideal visions can be achievable. </p><br></br>
        
        <h2 class="my-2">Two Sides of Me</h2><br>
        
        <p><span style="margin-left: 40px;">Sort</span> of, am I a lark or a night owl? Maybe or both, it depends on how to improve my productivity. Procrastination does makes me feel unproductive. My dreams got suck out of it. This weird feeling and sensation of negativity rushing through my mind is pretty unhelpful. In order to do something better, try, no if(s), no but(s) or not(s). I try to uplift myself even I'm alone and I felt empty inside. Be positive, is in my blood. I'm trying not to jump into conclusions, I tend to inspect some facts and opinions though sometimes it looks like they're almost similar. Consistency is definitely a thing that makes me a bit of brood to think of what if I didn't maintain properly. My life would be in a cone of shame. It's just everything has changing real quick.</p></span></br>
        
        <p><span style="margin-left: 40px;">To</span> be straightforward, I'm a kind of person who's friendly and quirky. Overall, neighborhood compliment me as a savvy and ideal. For what, I'm a bit curious? Anyway. Words of wisdom of the day: You can't fight in an argument when there's no winning in the first place. It's just like you wanted them to listen as a matter of fact they didn't, there's nothing to give reason for. What I'm really scared of was my own anger because it's not much as terrifying but wicked enough to murder someone's soul. I will ignore you to death. There's no point of listening to, it was such a nonsense believing in you, something like that. Also, I am a type of person who trust easily and then get fooled. You know what, I trusted a person once I thought this guy is trustworthy. I should've known he's a chameleon that really mocks up the wall and I accused the wrong one because of stupid bill. Next is, I found out this person I thought to be a nice, helpful and nosy if you look at, deep down this gal is nothing but a deepfake. Then, this type of persons has a characteristic of a mosquito and a snake. Good at favors, after that, stabbing you in a back. So, I'm not expecting anything from everyone because I know if I ever did it'll only breaks my heart. This presumably a pseudo-persons that I trusted because of their sweet, noble, and reasonable promises. Well, I thought they're good. I should've known they're corrupted so good at their egoistic position. They're not a leader, they're just worst as my horrible bosses. Now, I realized that it's a same conflicts in a different situations. Maybe, I'm the problem. It's like I haven't learned from anything. It's a loop of never ending tragic experiences.</p><br>
        
        <p><span style="margin-left: 40px">Sometimes,</span> it's not bad to be a knave if you want to secure for the future. Furthermore, it's better late than never. Time management really hit me through the nerve. It makes my nerves shock and drives me insane. Lastly, I'm a kind of a person who has a level of depths of understanding and patience. Even it's truly annoying. I'm trying to control my vulnerable emotions, extremely. If it doesn't, it's the end my line. The truth is, no matter how exceptional you are, the real talented people enslaved of money and getting replaced anytime. We always get what we deserve.</p><br></br>
        
        <h2 class="my-2">A Great Educational Experience</h2><br>
        
        <p><span style="margin-left: 40px;">To</span> be real, I don't know if there's a future awaits for me. So, I always make a plan in order to be prepared for a next day. Those expectations are high because everything goes according to the plan. Those fears makes me feel anxious and this intrusive thoughts destroys my inner peace and sleep. I've been gone through depression and anxiety lately. There's a  possibility it'll occur again. You know, when I was in the middle grade I was just as ecstatic. I'm a happy-go-lucky type of person who appreciate company and  what matters to me. Friendship, love (let's skip to that part) and an outstanding academic performance. But now, it doesn't matter anymore. I just want a disploma. Some academic kmowledgeable standard is useless to the real life implications. Let's say I unlock something, something bigger. The unjust part of our lives, to make it short, it is easy and achievable with a backer. I realized that mindset before was just an eye of a pleaser kid. Being private and selective is not so bad. I just remember my former teacher Sir. Butch J. Vi√±as of what he said, "Enjoy the moment." He is the best of the best adviser and also a personal friend of mine. It was at the peak of pandemic which is, sad. He's a good influence, and I remember that time me and my bestfriend rant about K to 12. It absurd and hilarious. I was a bit ahead of myself when I wanted to go college too soon. That was super embarrassing and I was a laughingstock of a month, back in a day.</p><br>
        
        <p><span style="margin-left: 40px;">I</span> mean, enjoying the moment I do. I just wanted to enjoy life. I just wanted to enjoy being a single. Still, I have a 1 decade or more than 20 years to mingle and enjoy the ultimate freedom. But not forever, because I don't want to die single, home alone. Time will come that I will build a foundation that serves as a powerhouse but not now, it kinda overwhelms me. I don't want to live in the sty and I look like a bug with my kid. I can't live with that.</p><br></br>
        
        <h2 class="my-2">Work Alcoholic</h2><br>
        
        <p><span style="margin-left: 40px;">Until</span> those awesome moments slowly fade away. When my dormant sickness reactived. I thought that time my days were over. For the record, that was just the beginning of another. For a first time in my life I'm petrified and unsure from unpredictable threats. Too much is bad, I get it now. It is true. Abusing yourself is not a good idea. I feel amazed at my schtick, editing videos for a living, proofreading some contents from anonynous requests of online persons, no biggie. Video chat with a friend overseas. Then, it goes sideways. College life is off from a rough start. I am couping that time, deciding for what is right. I miss my friends. I miss the time where I used to that feels. I miss the old me. So, I decided to stop. It's an eye-opener that maybe I was saturated and formulated, exposed at gadgets. I tried to explore myself into uncharted direction. I diverted myself and tried to find a job and eventually I did. Alhough it takes a couple of months to be employed. The online application and qualifications, a batch of group interview, a duration of one week training and securing a documents. For a meantime, I did some blueprints and outlines for a book. Posting some random ideas across different platforms. Though I didn't expect that call, I've been officially hired in a developing company. It was such a great feeling also I got to take care of required documents by myself from Naga to Iriga to Goa. Going to the office, to the work field, and back home is a great thing. Besides, what could possibly happen?</p><br>
        
        <p><span style="margin-left: 40px;">Without</span> a doubt, I had a good feeling about it. What a memorable experience to break away. When my superior handed me a liquor that day it changes everything. I travel everyday, goes along with the streets of Naga, Gainza and a sneak peak at Minalabac. Then, back at home for another sideline every weekend. I had to wake up at 3 am in the morning, sleeping on a bus as goes around. It was exhausting but I get used to that customs. Traffic jams aren't common in the city. Province is pretty decent, too. It's a full time job and I'm happy. The thing is I'm satisfied, for some reason bosses are very stressful over an enraged customer. They're trying to test your patience. This kind of work is much as double the calvary from academic torture. To the point I snapped in and reckoned. I must turn around. I don't want to be like this forever to grew old, stressed, pure of wrinkles for life. So, I took a calculated risk. When you're already love something and you're comfortable in that zone despite the fact that you need to let it go. Those sacrifices to make you get there it's hard --- to choose, to start over. And then, I have to step out in that comfort zone again. I can't believe I just did that. What I've really need for now is to adapt. People comes and goes, I guess. There's no regrets going back to college, so far. I hope I didn't shift or transfer or quit this time. I'm anticipating a lots of fun and bundles of challenges for this one.</p><br></br><br></br>
